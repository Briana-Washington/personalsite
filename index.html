                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>I joined an organization called <a href="https://coderspace.org/">CoderSpace</a> in 2015 as a high school junior. I received an email from my principal about it , and my mom made me apply. A fond story I enjoy sharing is how CoderSpace's
                    co-founder, Mr. Demond, waitlisted me because I told him I didn't like working in teams. I later called him and asked if I wasn't getting in, and he decided to let me join CoderSpace.</p>
                <p>During my time there, I learned front-end languages (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and made one for a locally black-owned business. I was voted for team leader by my teammates and learned what leadership is all about that summer. The following
                    summers of 2016 and 2017, I returned to CoderSpace as a teaching assistant. I was promoted as an instructor in the 2018 summer (which later turned into a project management job), and decided to finally acknowledge my interest in technology.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying technology and hope to learn more languages to decide which field(s) in tech I enjoy!</p>

                <p>I'm planning on writing a fantasy book for NanoWriMo, but I'm also doing interactive fiction in order to bring tech and writing/publishing together. </p>
                <p>I also write poetry, mostly in private and it's not anywhere on the internet.</p>
                <p>And here are some examples of the videography I like to do:</p>

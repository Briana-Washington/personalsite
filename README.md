This is the personal website for Briana C. Washington. Most of the code is done by myself. 

The image of myself on my homepage was taken by Marcia Eastmond.

I also put TailoRite Cleaners on this site. Although I was apart of the team that coded the website, I just wanted to clarify that the owner of TailoRite is Dr. Joseph Caldwell and Veta Caldwell-Charles.

Fonts are from Google. I used Bellefair for the paragraphs and Handlee for the headers.

And of course, where would I be without CoderSpace teaching me everything I know about code?

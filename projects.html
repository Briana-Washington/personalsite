        <p>In the summer of 2015, I had the pleasure of coding a website for a local black-owned business in my community with a team of three other teens. TailoRite is a family owned Dry Cleaners that has been around for over 60 years. They specialize in
            dry cleaning and clothing alterations. "With over 50 years of experience, why choose anyone else?"</p>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Red-Lights-Briana-Washington/dp/1520702752/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1500248571&sr=8-5&keywords=running+red+lights" target="_blank"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41l9hMevKiL._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Running Red Lights cover" id="book" /></a>

        <p>I self-published an autobiography of sorts. A short book on coming-of-age, blah, blah. It sounds much more terrible than it actually is, but I will still try my best to make it sound appealing:</p>

            <div class="book">
                <p>Second edition. "Make new friends, make new friends. Melody is nice, but you should make new friends. I didn't want to, but I agreed. What else was suppose to say?" Old English freondscipe "friendship, mutual liking and regard,"
                also "conjugal love;". Conjugal meant of or relating to marriage or the relationship of a married couple. Old English freond, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch vriend and German Freund, from an Indo-European root meaning 'to love,'.
                Surely such words were meant for a deep relationship . . . Growing up is hard. Briana Washington is an easily-forgettable black girl that has a crippling disability of making friends. But she also has to learn about being a woman, and
                just what the heck are boys anyway? There's coping with anxiety attacks and random flairs of depression, and lots of instances of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

        <h1>Current Projects</h1>
        
        <h2>Podcast</h2>
        
        <p>I am currently working on a podcast with two of my close friends. It will be a social commentary of sorts, with some episodes addressing social justice and others just being a personal journal of sorts. Still in development.</p>
        
        <h2>Lessons on RSS</h2>
        
        <p>During my adventures in creating a podcast. I've learned how to code and RSS feed. I think many people can benefit from it and want to teach it to others. I'm thinking of doing a short lesson on it for $2. It's still in very early development.</p>
